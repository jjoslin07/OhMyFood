### Scenario
You have just been recruited at Ohmyfood as a junior developer. Congratulations!

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!

</p>

You are one of the four lucky ones who have the chance to work on this project.

The team is composed of :

-Paul, the CTO of the future site.
-Emily, the UX designer, recruited to create the site’s UI design.
-Anissa, the sales representative in charge of canvassing the restaurants.
-You, in charge of the development of the site.

Anissa is in the process of contacting the restaurants for this project. When she runs into you at the coffee machine, she says: 

Have you heard the news? Remember the sales manager of your favorite restaurant? I managed to convince him and three others to put their menus online! I'll send you the file with the four menus in the afternoon. It's up to you now!

With the team, you decide that the prototype will contain these fourmenus.  

Here is the [brief](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Web%20Developer%20P3/Creative%20Brief%20-%20Ohmyfood!.pdf) you draw up with the CTO, Paul.
Back at your desk, you find the mock-ups of the site in your mailbox, sent by Emily.

</p>

You now have all the elements you need to build this mobile site. 

> Please do not use any images of full web pages from the mock-ups, only incorporate individual image assets into your site where they are needed, such as restaurant logos, banners, etc.

### Deliverables
- A link to your GitHub repository.
- A link to your web page (located in the README of your GitHub repository). 

Your deliverable must be named using the following convention: Fullname_#_StartDate_A The # refers to the number of the project on the path. The start date should be in the mmddyyyy format. If you have multiple deliverables, change the letter at the end (ex. “A” for the first deliverable, “B” for the second deliverable, etc.). All deliverables must be publicly accessible.

### Project Presentation 

The presentation will be structured as follows, with the assessor playing Paul:
- Presentation and explanation of deliverables (15 minutes)
- Discussion (10 min)
  - The assessor will ask you questions about your methodology and your deliverables.
  - Be prepared to defend your work, as the assessor will challenge your decisions.

The assessor will stop playing the role of Paul five minutes before the end of the session so that you can debrief together.
